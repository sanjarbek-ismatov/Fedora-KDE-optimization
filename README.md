# My setup scripts for Fedora KDE
## It includes:
- RPM Fusion support
- Multimedia codecs and HW acceleration
- TLP + Sleep fix (For my Laptop)
- Debloating (most unnecessary packages, services and autostarts are removed, firewall-config is changed to plasma-firewall for easier integration, chrony is replaced to systemd-timesyncd to save more resources)
